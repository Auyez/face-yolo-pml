# face-yolo-pml
An attempt to detect faces using simplified version of YOLO.\
\
The project uses keras and plaidML as a backend because I was too lazy to install linux distribution on my pc with AMD GPU (to use tensorflow), so I searched for the ways to do it on Windows.\
\
All code was written only using keras; Therefore, it probably should run with any other backend without any problems.\
\
It is not COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION of YOLO, it can only detect one class and uses only one anchor box.\
\
\
CODE MIGHT CONTAINT A LOT OF ERRORS, MAY BE THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT CORRECT AT ALL!!!
